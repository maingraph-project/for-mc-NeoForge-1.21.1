**Maingraph for MC** is a visual blueprint engine designed for Minecraft. It allows for custom logic through intuitive node connections, requiring no (or very little) coding.

## Compatibility Notes

Currently known compatibility limitations with the following mods:

1. **IMBlocker**: Since v0.2.2, when the native Minecraft EditBox was adopted, IMBlocker has been compatible.
- **Just Enough Characters (Pinyin Search)**: The Blueprint Editor’s search function does not currently support the Pinyin search provided by Just Enough Characters.
    - **Estimated Fix**: No plans at the moment.

## Quick Start

1. **Installation**: Place the mod in your Minecraft `mods` folder (requires NeoForge).
2. **Open Editor**: Once in-game, press `Ctrl + M` to open the Blueprint Manager.
3. **Create Blueprint**: Enter a name and click "Create".
4. **Start Authoring**: Right-click on the canvas to add nodes, connect white arrows (execution flow) and colored dots (data flow).
5. **Save & Run**: Click "Save", and your logic will start running in the background.
