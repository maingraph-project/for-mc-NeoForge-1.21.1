## v0.2.7

- **New Features**:
    - **Blueprint Manager**:
        - Added "Copy" function to the context menu, supporting quick cloning of existing blueprint files.
    - **Security Node Control**:
        - Added configuration item `allow_server_run_command_node` to control whether blueprints containing the `run_command_as_server` node are allowed to be saved, enhancing server security.
- **Fixes**:
    - **Blueprint Version Prompt**:
        - Fixed an issue where the "Copy and Open" button in the version conflict prompt was non-functional in multiplayer mode.
    - **Internationalization**:
        - Completed missing Tooltip translations for some configuration items.
- **Optimizations**:
    - **Architectural Refactoring**:
        - **God Object Decoupling**: Extracted view animation, history management, and auto-layout functions from `BlueprintState` into independent `ViewManager`, `HistoryManager`, and `LayoutManager` classes.
        - **Network Layer Decoupling**: Established an independent `NetworkService`, where the UI calls business interfaces instead of directly constructing network packets, improving code maintainability.
    - **Performance and Security**:
        - **Memory Overflow Defense**: Replaced `ByteBufCodecs.STRING_UTF8` with the length-limited `stringUtf8(1048576)` to prevent potential memory overflow issues.
        - **Logic Realignment**: Optimized client/server logic distribution (CE), moving server logic that was previously executed on the client to the server side.
    - **Log Cleanup**:
        - Lowered the log level for blueprint execution from `INFO` to `DEBUG`.
